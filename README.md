# python-project-tic-tac-toe-game
This Python program is a very simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game played in the terminal. The game uses a list of nine positions to represent the board. Players X and O take turns by choosing a position (1–9) to place their mark. After each move, the board is displayed, and the program checks if the current player has won by forming a row &amp; column.
